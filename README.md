# 25-beginner-project
The 2025 beginner project

The end goal for this project is to teach students about designing PCBs, soldering, microprocessors, and programming using the arduino. 

This repository contains an example project that students can use to compare their solutions to, or maybe as a starter point.

The idea is to use an 8-bit shift register to display a sequence of pre-programmed lights via 1 pinout.
